# About bestbadtweets.com

bestbadtweets.com is a web application that aggregates the best of the worst tweets on Twitter. **This is not a Twitter website and is not affiliated with Twitter** or any other media company. Some tweets are nominated internally but also some nominations are suggested by the community.

This site was registered, designed and programmed by [@jessegreathouse][1], just another Twitter user. The idea of the site was conceived when Jesse read an article about the worst tweets. He realized that there was some humorous value in truly bad tweets, but in the context of a single article, there was no official recognition to these tweets other than the author randomly targeting a few arbitrary tweets. The idea of bestbadtweets.com is that the Twitter community can suggest and also vote on which are the best of the worst tweets on Twitter.

## No malice intended 

The purpose of this site is not to insult, make-fun-of, or otherwise ridicule any of the participants or the tweeters involved. We like to focus on the tweet itself and not who is responsible for it. It is not meant to single out or hurt any individual. We all like to joke, laugh and have fun, and if a tweet of yours is nominated, please realize it is in the spirit of having fun and not being rude or hateful. Please consider it a compliment that someone got a laugh out of your tweet. You just brightened someones day
